#### Roadmap 2

Since bevy isn't embeddable into raw wasm, we'll currently skip `ecs` and instead we'll make a Grid Embedder and a `grid-core` Plugin.

- [ ] Grid embedder host calls
- [ ] `grid-core`

After we finish grid embedder, we'll make some grid based retro games and then finally we're going to try with `hecs`. If `hecs` is not convenient, we'll continue doing our custom ECS.

- [ ] 2D Embedder host calls
- [ ] `hecs-core`
